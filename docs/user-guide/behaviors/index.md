# Behaviors

## Understanding Customer Behaviors

Behaviors are powerful customer clustering tools that help you segment and understand your audience based on shopping patterns, preferences, and lifestyle characteristics. Our platform enables you to create meaningful products/customer groups for targeted marketing campaigns, personalized experiences, and data-driven decision making.

## What are Behaviors?

Behaviors allow you to organize customers and products into distinct clusters based on shared characteristics and shopping patterns. These clusters help you:

- **Segment by purchase behavior and style** - Identify customers with similar shopping habits and preferences or similar products
- **Generate custom customer bases** - Create targeted audiences for CRM campaigns and media advertising
- **Enrich customer profiles** - Add valuable insights and attributes to better understand your audience
- **Personalize product recommendations** - Match the right products with the right customer segments

## Types of Behaviors
