## How Our AI Works

### Intent Mapping Process

1. **Product Navigation**: Tracks products users have navigated during the session
2. **Category Elements**: Analyzes visual elements like silhouettes, patterns, and styling details
3. **Pattern Insights**: Identifies textures, fabrics, and structural elements
4. **Styling Intent**: Understands occasion, style preferences, and versatility needs
5. **User Behavior**: Cross-references searches, products, and past purchases for logged-in users
6. **Intent Prediction**: Relates products from different categories based on style mapping

### Example: Dress Navigation Analysis

When a user navigates dresses, our AI identifies:

**Category Elements:**
- V-neck silhouette
- Spaghetti straps
- Defined waistline
- A-line or flared skirt

**Pattern Insights:**
- Vertical pleating
- Botanical or minimalist textures
- Lightweight, airy fabrics
- Subtle structured tailoring

**Styling Intent:**
- Feminine yet contemporary
- Suggests confidence, delicacy, and movement
- Day-to-night versatility
- Ideal for spring/summer social occasions
