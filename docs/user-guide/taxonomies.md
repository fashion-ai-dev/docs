# Taxonomies

Taxonomies are data structures that define how to describe products in a standardized way. Think of it as a "dictionary" that teaches the system to generate descriptions, SEO content, colors, sizes, etc. for e-commerce products.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### üìã Two Types of Taxonomy

| Type | Description | Who Uses |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Global Taxonomy** | Standard created by administrators | ‚úÖ All clients |
| **Custom Taxonomy** | Version customized by client | üë§ Specific client |

### üîÑ Workflow

1. **Administrator creates** global taxonomy
2. **System distributes** to all clients
3. **Client can customize** their version

## üéõÔ∏è Automatic Categories

Some groups automatically apply to all product categories:

- üé® **Prints and Colors** - Pattern and color palette descriptions
- üëî **Pairs With** - Suggestions for harmonizing pieces
- üí∞ **Sales Support** - Arguments and benefits for sales
- üîç **SEO Content** - Content optimized for search engines

üí° **Important:** When you edit a property of these types, it's automatically copied to all existing categories.

## üî¢ Versioning System

### How Version Control Works

**Global Taxonomy:**
- Numbered versions: v1, v2, v3...
- Each update generates a new version

**Client Taxonomy:**
- Format: major.minor (example: 2.1, 2.2)
- **Major:** Based on received global version
- **Minor:** Increases with each client customization - cliente can edit simutaneous categories before saving and generating a new version

### Practical Example

1. Client receives global taxonomy v2 ‚Üí Their version becomes **2.0**
2. Client makes first set of customizations ‚Üí Version **2.1**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If cliente want to make a version with the first and the second set of customizations, the client should edit second set from version **2.1**, which has to be selected manually on the version selector, by default its the main version.

3. Client makes second set of customizations ‚Üí Version **2.2**
4. Admin releases new global version v3 ‚Üí Client can opt to receive as **3.0**

## üìö Available Operations

- Customize taxonomies (edit examples and adjustments)
- Create complete custom versions
- **Set version as main** to make it active for product processing
- Reset to global version by setting main version

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Customize

### Step-by-Step for Clients

1. **Access** your taxonomies on the platform
2. **Select** the category you want to customize
3. **Edit examples** specific to your business
4. **Save** as new custom version
5. **Set as main version** to activate for product processing

## üéØ Activating a Taxonomy Version

### Setting Main Version

To make a taxonomy version active for processing your products:

1. **Navigate** to your My Style Ai page
2. **Choose** the version you want to activate (e.g., "2.1", "2.2")
3. **Click "Set as Main"** to make it the active version
4. **Confirm** the change

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only the **main version** is used to process products. Other versions remain available but inactive.

### What Happens When You Set Main

‚úÖ **The system will use this taxonomy to:**
- Generate product descriptions
- Create SEO content
- Extract product attributes

‚ùå **Inactive versions:**
- Remain saved for reference
- Can be activated later
- Don't affect product processing

### Version Management Tips

- **Keep backup** of working versions
- **Document changes** you make to custom versions
- **Make huge edits** you can make huge edits and generate one version
- **Update main version** seasonally for best results

### Customization Tips

- Use language consistent with your brand
- Add terms specific to your niche
