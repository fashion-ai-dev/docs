# How to Create and Manage Collections

Learn to create custom product collections to display on your website easily and quickly.

## What are Collections?

Collections are groups of products you choose to highlight on your website. For example:
- New releases of the week
- Products on sale
- Summer looks
- Bestsellers

## Step by Step

### 1. Access Collections

### 4. Configure Collection Information

You will see a page divided into two parts:

**Top Section**: Collection information
- Collection name
- Description
- URL (endpoint) to use this collection on your site
- Generate link button (mobile feed to view collection products - active slice)

**Bottom Section**: Slices (collection versions)

### 5. Understanding Slices

Slices are different versions of your collection. You can create several, but only one is active at a time.

**Why use slices?**
- Prepare a new version without affecting the one currently live
- Perform A/B testing with different products
- Have seasonal versions ready to activate

> **Tip**: Products will appear on the site in exactly the order you define here.

## Publishing Your Collection

When your collection is ready:

1. Review that all products are correct
2. Check that the order is as you want
3. Select the period this slice should be active

Done! Your collection will now be available on the website.

## Important Tips

✅ **Only one active**: Remember that only one slice is active at a time

✅ **Test first**: Always review before activating a new slice
