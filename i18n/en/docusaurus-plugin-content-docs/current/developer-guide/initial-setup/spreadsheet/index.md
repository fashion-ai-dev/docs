# Spreadsheet Import

Import your product catalog using spreadsheet templates for easy bulk uploads.

## Overview

The spreadsheet import method allows you to upload your product catalog using CSV file. This is ideal for:
- Initial bulk product imports
- Product catalog updates
- Offline catalog management
- Migration from other systems

## Getting Started

1. **Download Template**
   - Get the spreadsheet template from your FashionAI dashboard by clicking Settings > Products Manager
   - Review the required fields and format in "Spreadsheet Fields"

2. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Fill in product information
   - Include required fields
   - Add optional attributes for better recommendations

3. **Upload File**
   - Log in to your dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Products Manager
   - Upload your spreadsheet file

4. **Validate Import**
   - Review import summary
   - Import result can be total error (error appears detailed in imports list), partial (with list of non-imported products and why) or total success (all products were imported)
   - Fix any errors
   - Re-import the spreadsheet, products that were already successful will only be updated, not duplicated

## Required Fields

Find the required fields for your company in Settings > Products Manager > Spreadsheet Fields

## Best Practices

1. **Use Consistent IDs** - Keep product IDs consistent across updates
2. **High-Quality Images** - Use clear product images with good resolution
3. **Complete Descriptions** - Provide detailed product descriptions
4. **Accurate Categories** - Use consistent category naming
5. **Regular Updates** - Keep your catalog up to date

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Import Errors** - Check required fields are filled
- **Duplicate IDs** - Ensure each product has a unique ID
- **Image Issues** - Verify image URLs are accessible
