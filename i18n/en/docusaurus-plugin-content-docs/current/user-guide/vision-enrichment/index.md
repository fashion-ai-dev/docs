# Vision Enrichment

Vision Enrichment allows you to improve the accuracy of our artificial intelligence through feedback and adjustments. The more you interact with the system, the more it learns about your preferences and needs.

## How it works

The AI learns from your actions in three main ways:

1. **Editing attributes** - When you correct or enhance automatically generated descriptions and attributes
2. **Providing categorization feedback** - When you validate or adjust categories suggested by the AI
3. **Managing taxonomies** - Through the [Taxonomy page](../taxonomy/index), you can structure and organize your categories in a personalized way

## Why use it

- **More accurate descriptions**: The AI learns your style and generates content aligned with your brand
- **Smart categorization**: Over time, the AI improves category suggestions for your products
- **Time savings**: The more you train the system, the fewer manual adjustments will be needed

## Tips

- Review and correct generated attributes whenever possible
- Provide consistent feedback to accelerate learning
- Adjustments made benefit all future cataloging of similar products
