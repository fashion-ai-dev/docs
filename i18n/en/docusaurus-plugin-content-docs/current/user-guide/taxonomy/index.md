# Taxonomy

Taxonomies are data structures that define how to describe products in a standardized way. Think of it as a "dictionary" that teaches the system to generate descriptions, SEO content, colors, sizes, etc. for e-commerce products.

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 📋 Two Types of Taxonomy

| Type | Description | Who Uses |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Global Taxonomy** | Standard created by administrators | ✅ All clients |
| **Custom Taxonomy** | Version customized by client | 👤 Specific client |

### 🔄 Workflow

1. **Administrator creates** global taxonomy
2. **System distributes** to all clients
3. **Client can customize** their version

## 🎛️ Automatic Categories

Some groups automatically apply to all product categories:

- 🎨 **Prints and Colors** - Pattern and color palette descriptions
- 👔 **Pairs With** - Suggestions for harmonizing pieces
- 💰 **Sales Support** - Arguments and benefits for sales
- 🔍 **SEO Content** - Content optimized for search engines

💡 **Important:** When you edit a property of these types, it's automatically copied to all existing categories.

### Version Management Tips

- **Keep backup** of working versions
- **Document changes** you make to custom versions
- **Make huge edits** you can make huge edits and generate one version
- **Update main version** seasonally for best results

### Customization Tips

- Use language consistent with your brand
- Add terms specific to your niche
