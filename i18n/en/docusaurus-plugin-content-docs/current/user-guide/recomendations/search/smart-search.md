# Smart Product Search

Our AI-powered search helps your customers find exactly what they're looking for, even when they use natural language or describe what they need instead of using exact product names.

## How It Works

Traditional search only finds exact matches. Our smart search understands intent and context:

**Customer searches for:** "blue dress for wedding"

**Our AI understands:**
- Color preference: Blue
- Product type: Dress
- Occasion: Formal/wedding appropriate
- Style context: Elegant, sophisticated

**Results include:**
- Navy cocktail dresses
- Royal blue formal dresses
- Light blue evening gowns
- Similar formal attire in complementary colors

## Key Features

### Natural Language Understanding

Customers can search the way they naturally speak:
- "Comfortable running shoes" â†’ Athletic footwear with comfort features
- "Gift for teenage daughter" â†’ Age-appropriate trending items
- "Business casual summer" â†’ Professional warm-weather clothing

### Smart Typo Tolerance

Search still works even with spelling mistakes:
- "sneekers" finds sneakers
- "t-shrt" finds t-shirt
- "dres" finds dress

### Context-Aware Results

The search learns from browsing behavior to show more relevant results:
- Previous category views influence search ranking
- Recent product interactions refine results
- Session history improves personalization

### Synonym Recognition

Understands different ways to describe the same thing:
- "Sneakers" = "Tennis shoes" = "Athletic shoes"
- "Purse" = "Handbag" = "Bag"
- "Pants" = "Trousers" = "Slacks"

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Search Bar

Power your main product search with intelligent, conversational understanding. Customers find products faster, reducing bounce rates and increasing conversions.

### WhatsApp Commerce

Enable customers to search your catalog naturally through messaging:
- "Show me red shoes under $100"
- "Do you have winter coats?"
- "I need a gift for my mom"
