# Search for WhatsApp

Enable your customers to search and shop your entire product catalog directly through WhatsApp conversations using natural language.

## What Is WhatsApp Search?

A specialized search feature designed specifically for WhatsApp commerce that lets customers browse and discover products through conversational messaging.

Unlike website search, WhatsApp Search returns complete product information (images, prices, links) ready to share instantly in a chat conversation.

## How It Works

Your customers message your WhatsApp Business number and can search naturally:

**Customer types:** "Show me red dresses"

**They receive:**
- Product images
- Product names
- Prices (including sale prices)
- Direct links to purchase
- All formatted for easy mobile viewing

## Why WhatsApp Search?

### Meet Customers Where They Are

WhatsApp is how many customers prefer to shop:
- 2+ billion active users worldwide
- Familiar, trusted platform
- Easy back-and-forth conversation
- No app download or account creation needed

### Complete Shopping Experience

Customers can:
- Search your full catalog
- Ask questions about products
- Compare options
- Get recommendations
- Complete purchases
- Track orders

All without leaving WhatsApp.

### Natural Conversation

No rigid commands or specific keywords needed. Customers search the way they talk:
- "Do you have comfortable shoes?"
- "I need a gift for my sister"
- "Show me winter coats under $200"
- "What's on sale?"

## Use Cases

### Direct Customer Sales

Small businesses and boutiques can sell directly through WhatsApp without needing a full e-commerce website.

### Customer Service Enhancement

Support teams can quickly find and share products when customers ask questions.

### Personal Shopping

Sales associates can act as personal shoppers, searching and sharing products based on customer needs.
